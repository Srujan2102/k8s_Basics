Role and Rolebinding
********************

Role --> Series of actions that perform on particular objects or resources like list and update

eg: if there are 10 devops users who are working in different namespaces like (Dev, UAT,SAT, PROD, PREPOD) 

1 user is admin and other 9 are normal users 

if one user deletes a deployment it stops the traffic for this purpose we need to implement RBAC(Role Based Access Control)

Role and Rolebindings is of 2 types
***********************************
1. Namespace level
2. Cluster level

--> roles and rolebindings at namespace level
1. role
2. rolebinding

--> roles and rolebindings at cluster level 
1. clusterrole
2. clusterrolebinding

 In this roles we need to mention the resources like Pod, deployment or statefulset 

role--> It is nothing but giving actions to perform (list,update) 

role binding -->  roles are attach to the user using role binding




RBAC --> Rolling back access authentication controller 
eg:by mistake user delete some resources what to do for that purpose we use 
1. Role/cluster role
2. Role binding/ cluster binding 

Role --> single namespace
****
api groups

resources (pod , deploy, service)

verbs nothing but actions ( read , write)

cluster role --> more than one name space
