HPA and VPA
***********

we can do the manual and automated scaling of pods 

1. manual scaling we can do by changing the no. of replicas
	kubectl scale rs/replicaset-name --replicas = 2

2. Automated scaling of pods by HPA and VPA

HPA--> Horizontal Pod Autoscaling
*********************************

By default k8s is HPA

--> Increasing or scale up the pods called as HPA

eg: In a single pod we are using an app with usage of 50% that has 100%
   if it reaches 50% we scale up the pods by HPA , we can also use multiple pods

--> create a Jenkins application and note down the cpu and check the cpu and memory usage of Jenkins by running the command 

	kubectl top pods --> for this install metrics server

eg: we are having 1000mm cpu and replica 1 as min replica 3 as max in that it requests 500mm  if the pod cpu utilization crosses the 50% of cpu allocated to the Jenkins pod  then scale up the pods to 3 replicas




Load balancing --> Distributing the load among the existing servers(Elastic load balancer in AWS)

in k8s among the pods uses replication controllers

Autoscaling --> based on the cpu utilization or based on the requests 

scale up or scale down the servers(desired min and max number of servers)

In k8s scale up or scale down the pods in diff servers

-------------------------------------

Vertical Pod AutoScaling
************************
--> Increasing the capacity of the server(RAM and storage) 

--> Increasing Resources of the pods(cpu and memory) 

--> when users or requests are increasing we have to increase the pods or strength of the pods

--> If it gets deleted the pod for not handling thus creates the new pod with higher cpu and memory thus we get the downtime thats why we use mostly HPA

--> The more the cpu's and memory the more the users can handle 
 
--> VPA is installed through autoscaler

--> we need metric server for both HPA and VPA

Life cycle of pod
*****************

1. pending 
2. container creating
3. Running


when installing k8s cluster HPA will be installed default

If you want to delete the existing we have to follow the order 
	1. HPA
	2. Service
	3. Deployment
